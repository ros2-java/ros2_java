# Contributing to ROS 2 Java

This document contains rules and guidelines for contributing to the ROS 2 Java project.

## How to contribute

Here are a few things you can do to contribute to the project:

1. Report a bug by opening an issue on GitHub
2. Even better, open a **pull request** fixing the bug!

If you open a ticket, be patient while waiting for a response; The ROS 2 Java team is small.
While you wait, other excellent ways to contribute include:

1. Leave constructive feedback on an open pull request
2. Try to reproduce an existing bug report and leave a comment

## Pull requests

Each pull request must satisfy the following requirements before it can be merged:

1. Target the latest developement branch (`main`)
2. Have one approval from a maintainer
3. Continuous integration (CI) is building and passing tests
    - This should be automatically triggered upon opening a pull request
